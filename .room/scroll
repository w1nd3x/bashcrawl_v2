# You are awake and you are one cranky princess.
# It's time to head to the kitchens and get some chocolate.
#
# To look around a room, type:  ls
# To move around, type (don't include the <,>):  cd <directory>
#
# Try looking around this room.
# Then move into one of the next rooms.
#
# EXAMPLE:
#
# $ ls 
# $ cd tower
#
# Remember to look around with ``ls`` when you get into the next room!
