# It's hard to tell what's a doorway and what's an object.

# You can look around a little harder like this:
# 
# ls -F
# 
# Directories (the rooms) end with a / symbol.
# 
# Programs (encounters) end with a * symbol.
#
# You can avoid having to type ls -F every time by running the
# following:
#
# alias ls='ls -F'
#
# This is known as a shell or command alias.  With this alias,
# typing simply ls by itself will run ls -F. Try it out!
# 
# Once you've experimented a bit head to the next room.
