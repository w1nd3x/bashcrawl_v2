# Are you tired of constantly typing in overly 
# long commands?  Does having to type in 
#       cat ~/.stats
# after every encounter bum you out?  It may be
# time for aliases then.  The alias command allows
# you to define a shortcut to a command.  If you
# find that you frequently don't put the s at the
# end of ls you can create an alias
#       alias l='ls'
# 
# Note that aliases only last until the end of a 
# terminal session (until you close the terminal)
# so if you want them to last longer you'll have 
# to edit the '.bashrc'.
