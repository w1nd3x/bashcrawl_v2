# Doors are relatively simple to make.
#
# If you would like to travel into new rooms, 
# just make one.  You can create new rooms (directories)
# using:
#       mkdir <directory> (don't include the <,>)
#
# The library will reveal all sorts of knowledge if you 
# can create the "Secret Room" and then activate the 
# sconce.
