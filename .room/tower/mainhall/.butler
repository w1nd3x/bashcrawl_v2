Well aren't you curious. 

Unfortunately there's nothing to be found here just yet.

Why don't you try heading towards the kitchens.

#   EXAMPLE: You would like to know about the command 'ls'

# 
#       Man will now list off everything he knows relating to 'ls'
#
#   To search through a manual:
#       type / followed by something you want to look for.
#
#   To finish looking at man's instructions just 
#       type the letter 'q'
# 
# OK Princess, search through ls' man page to find the option 
# to 'color' ls entries! Use this option with your ls command 
# to see what happens.
