# You enter the castle observatory.  The center of
# the room is dominated by a large telescope
# surrounded by tables full of star charts.
# 
# You remember the castle mage using the star charts
# and telescope to predict events, maybe you can 
# get a clue about that chocolate.
#
# Interact with the telescope to begin.
