# You step into a grand Entrance Hall, shrouded in 
# an air of mystery. Dimly lit torches cast 
# flickering shadows on the stone walls, revealing 
# intricate carvings of mythical creatures and 
# ancient symbols. The room is vast, with a high 
# ceiling that seems to vanish into darkness.
# 
# A grand staircase stretches ahead with a rich, 
# red carpet that leads to the upper floors of the 
# tower.  You notice many doors branching off of
# the staircase, but many seem hidden or locked.
