You found a beautiful **fire crystal**.

You can always check your wealth with this command:

cat ~/.stats

eof
    sed "s/Inventory:/Inventory: fire crystal,/; s/,$//" ~/.stats > ~/.stats.tmp && mv ~/.stats.tmp ~/.stats
    NUM=$(awk '/Treasure:/ { print $2 }' ~/.progress)
    let NUM=NUM+1
    sed "s/Treasure: .*\//Treasure: $(echo $NUM) \//" ~/.progress > ~/.progress.tmp && mv ~/.progress.tmp ~/.progress
else
    echo "This treasure has already been taken."
