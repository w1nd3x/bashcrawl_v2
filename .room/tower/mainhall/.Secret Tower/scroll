You enter the secret tower and see a large door 
ahead.  You appear to be in the antechamber of 
the large tower.

Everything in the tower has become hazy and obscured.

Consult with Man to determine how to use ls to see hidden items.

The door ahead is covered with runes and designs
and you feel an unnerving presence as you
approach.  The chocolate has got to be here.
