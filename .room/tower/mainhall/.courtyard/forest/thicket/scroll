# You walk into an ancient thicket with massive trees stretching upwards in all 
# directions.  As you circle the area searching for the thieves hideout you get
# the eerie feeling that not all is as it seems.
# 
# Man informs you that you can investigate the true nature of things using the
# command:
#        file <filename>
#  
# You have the feeling that one of these trees is not like the others.
