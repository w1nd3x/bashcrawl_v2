It's a beautiful day and you've just remembered 
you're a princess and finding this chocolate has 
been hard.  You remember there's a chair in the 
Main Hall and you have a fuzzy recollection that 
one of the commands you know will get man to 
fetch that chair for you...

Man will look through the instructions for you 
to try to find a command that you would like.
You can ask him by using:
    apropos <descriptor>

Try to figure out how to move the chair here
by asking man with apropos:
    apropos move
