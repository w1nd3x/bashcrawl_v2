# Welcome to The Network
# =====================

# This is a game to teach you the basics of Networking
# 
# You are the princess of the castle and have successfully 
# taken over a Networking company
#
# You no longer have any memory of the castle you live in, but you do 
# remember that there is chocolate in the kitchens... 
# and you are very hungry.  
# 
# Luckily each room of the castle has a scroll with helpful 
# instructions about getting around.  
#
# You can read the scroll with the command:
# 
#   cat scroll
