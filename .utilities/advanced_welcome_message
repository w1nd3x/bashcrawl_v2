# Now that you've freed the castle from it's enslavement you've realized that 
# you want more than castle life has to offer, you want to start an empire.
#

# If you can provide them with their deepest wishes, bringing everyone into the 
# fold should be a cakewalk.

# There is a small 'Village' nearby and you may be able to make a start on your 
# empire there.
#
