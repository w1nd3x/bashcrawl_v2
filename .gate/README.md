	blacksmith
		Was robbed! He can't find his prized anvil
		Once you find his anvil, he has you look to see if
		he has enough coal to light a fire. If you do, you have to 
		use head to redirect enough lines of 'high quality' coal into the 'forge' file
		head / tail
		uniq
	carpenter
		At first, he seems like a harmless person, but upon getting the confession from the 
		police station, you find that the carpenter was in cahoots with the criminal the 
		whole time! after that, he gives you the ledger of all the active jobs he has, 
		but they're super disorganized and he has duplicate jobs. He says that he'll turn in
		the anvil when you can sort his jobs. He even thinks he has some duplicate ones!
		sort
		head / tail

	sheriff
		Talk to him first in the PoliceStation. Once you do, the three suspects are generated,
		and talking to them to get their precise statements will require use of head (head-case henry),
		tail (tail-bone terry), and sort/uniq (sort-a uniq-ue sam)
