[start of statement] OKOK I did it! Or did I? HA! No, I didn't do it. We have fun, don't we? 

Darling, as much as I would have loved to steal that bumbling fools 

anvil, I've been living it up in the city! I haven't had the time or the locale

to commit such a darling crime. If I had, also, you would know. You do know why

they call me tail-bone Teresa, right? [end of statement]
