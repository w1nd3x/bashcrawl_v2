You won't find much of use from me, I was out exploring in the woods when the smith lost his anvil. 

I was trying to find myself some nice mushrooms to get through the next couple days in style, 

when I was immediately snatched up by the sheriff on my way back in! Now, I know I have a bit of a reputation, 

but this hardly seems fair, no? Next time I do something like this, you'll know princess. [end of statement]
