The woodshop appears to have a permanent haze to it as you walk in, presumably 
from the thin layer of sawdust over everything. Various planks of wood rest 
against the back corner, next to a large workbench with every sort of saw and 
blade fixed to its scored surface. 

The carpenter is hard at work in a dark-stained throne of a chair sanding what 
appears to be an ornately designed salt shaker when you walk in, and he doesn't 
immediately give too much indication that he's even noticed you.

Once you enter beyond the threshold of the shop, however, the floorboards under 
you begin to creak terrbily, and the carpenter's head inches upward until his 
eyes meet yours.

Once they do, you see the jolly light in them. He jumps to his feet, 
enthusiastically greets you, and begins to show you around the shop before you 
can get a word in.

EOF
}

carpenter_test() {
	cat << EOF

During a brief pause in his speech, you quickly ask if he knows anything about 
the blacksmith's missing anvil. He says that it's mighty unfortuante, but that 
he doesn't know anything about it. He indicates around his shop, and asks if it 
looks like he would have much use for such equipment. You have to admit, he has
a point.

EOF
}

carpenter_intro_2() {
	cat << EOF

When the carpenter feels confident that he's shown you everything in his 
possession, he asks if you're ready to apprentice with him. Completely caught 
off guard, you let him know that you're just visiting, and that, while 
flattered, have no plans to work with wood.

EOF
}
carpenter_recruit() {
    cat << EOF

The carpenter looks up from his work at your approach and smiles a toothy grin.

He begins rummaging around the shop pulling out random pieces of equipment and 
talking without pause about the techniques you'll need to know as his 
apprentice.

You back out of the room slowly so as not to catch his notice.

EOF
}
ledger_intro() {
    cat << EOF

When the carpenter sees you walk in with an air of authority and the arrest 
warrant in your hand, it's as if he knows the game is done. He walks over to 
you, hands in pockets, and confesses everything. How he'd been looking for 
something to ruin the metal-workers business for years, and when Sam showed up 
on his doorstep, it was just too good of an opportunity to pass up. 

He does have one request, however, which you find odd for someone about to be 
arrested. He says that he won't give up the location of the anvil unless you 
first sort through his massive job ledger. He says that it hasn't been sorted 
in years, and that there is a ton of duplicate jobs on there. Sort through it, 
he says, and then he will reveal the anvil.

[save the sorted, duplicate-removed ledger into the 'sorted_ledger.txt' file]

EOF
}

carpenter_arrest() {
    	cat << EOF

The carpenter thanks you for your work by sticking his hands out. Not sure what 
he was really thinking, you were never given handcuffs. But it's a good 
gesture. He appreciates your work, and seems pretty confident that he'll be 
back to start working through the jobs he has. Weirdly confident...

Before you leave, he opens up one of the wood panels on the floor, revealing a 
hidden compartment with a big ol shiny anvil contained within. At last!

EOF
}
carpenter_work() {
    cat << EOF

The carpenter looks at you weirdly, as you are the one standing between his 
freedom and imprisonment. It's probably time to get to work sorting out that 
ledger [into sorted_ledger.txt]

EOF

}

ledger_incorrect() {
    cat << EOF

The carpenter expresses that he is pretty sure there is still more refinement 
that can be done on the ledger. Get back to work!

EOF
}

carpenter_done() {
cat << EOF

The empty shop seems a little eerie. Hopefully someone maintains it until the 
carpenter returns.
