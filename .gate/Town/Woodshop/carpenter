The woodshop appears to have a permanent haze to it as you walk in, presumably from the
thin layer of sawdust over everything. Various planks of wood rest against the back corner,
next to a large workbench with every sort of saw and blade fixed to its scored surface. 

The carpenter is hard at work in a dark-stained throne of a chair sanding what appears to be
an ornately designed salt shaker when you walk in, and he doesn't immediately give too much 
indication that he's even noticed you.

Once you enter beyond the threshold of the shop, however, the floorboards under you begin to 
creak terrbily, and the carpenter's head inches upward until his eyes meet yours.

Once they do, you see the jolly light in them. He jumps to his feet, enthusiastically greets you,
and begins to show you around the shop before you can get a word in.

	cat << carpenter_test

During a brief pause in his speech, you quickly ask if he knows anything about the blacksmith's missing anvil. 
He says that it's mighty unfortuante, but that he doesn't know anything about it. He indicates 
around his shop, and asks if it looks like he would have much use for such equipment. You have to
admit, he has a point.

	cat << carpenter_intro_2

When the carpenter feels confident that he's shown you everything in his possession, he asks if you're ready to apprentice with him. 
Completely caught off guard, you let him know that you're just visiting, and that, while flattered, have no plans to work
with wood.

	cat << job_intro_
When the carpenter sees you walk in with an air of authority and the arrest warrant in your hand, it's as if 
he knows the game is done. He walks over to you, hands in pockets, and confesses everything. How he'd been looking
for something to ruin the metal-workers business for years, and when Sam showed up on his doorstep, it was just too
good of an opportunity to pass up. 

He does have one request, however, which you find odd for someone about to be arrested. He says that he won't give 
up the location of the anvil unless you first sort through his massive job ledger. He says that it hasnt' been sorted
in years, and that there is a ton of duplicate jobs on there. Sort through it, he says, and then he will reveal the anvil.

[save the sorted, duplicate-removed ledger into the 'sorted_ledger.txt' file]

The carpenter thanks you for your work by sticking his hands out. Not sure what he was really thinking, you were never
given handcuffs. But it's a good gesture. He appreciates your work, and seems pretty confident that he'll be back to start
working through the jobs he has. Weirdly confident...

Before you leave, he opens up one of the wood panels on the floor, revealing a hidden compartment with a big ol shiny anvil contained
within. At last!

The carpenter looks at you weirdly, as you are the one standing between his freedom and imprisonment. 
It's probably time to get to work sorting out that ledger [into sorted_ledger.txt]
freedom?
