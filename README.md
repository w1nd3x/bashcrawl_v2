# Welcome!

This is a game to teach you the basics of using a Linux terminal.  It is based on the original [bashcrawl CLI game](https://gitlab.com/slackermedia/bashcrawl) from [slackermedia](https://gitlab.com/slackermedia).

## Try it on your machine

To start playing, open a terminal.

`sudo ./bashcrawl start Basic`


## Play different levels

There are three levels to play through:
- Basic - `sudo ./bashcrawl start Basic`
- Advanced - `sudo ./bashcrawl start Advanced`
- Net - `sudo ./bashcrawl start Net`
